# JavaWebServerJSON
Java web server to process JSON date from Post request body

endpoints: /firstname

Things that I learnt so far from this project:

1. Data Serialization and Deserialization using ObjectMapper and Gson package
2. how to validate post request body's data using json validation schema - creating a json schema file that is used to define the rules for the incoming json data from the request body.
3. even the response is validated before sending it to the client.
